## Summary

✅ **All checks passed!** Feature map is accurate.

## Detailed Results

### File Paths: 52/52 found ✅
- All documented file paths exist in the repository
- Special handling implemented for:
  - Runtime directories (e.g., `vector-cache/` created at runtime)
  - Component-specific paths (e.g., `./server/.env.example`)

### LLM Providers: 27/27 found ✅
All documented LLM provider implementations verified:
- OpenAI, Anthropic, Azure OpenAI, AWS Bedrock, Google Gemini
- Cohere, Groq, Ollama, LM Studio, LocalAI, Text Generation WebUI
- KoboldCPP, Hugging Face, Fireworks AI, Together AI, Perplexity
- OpenRouter, DeepSeek, Mistral, xAI, Novita, NVIDIA NIM

### Embedding Engines: 12/12 found ✅
All documented embedding engine implementations verified:
- Native, OpenAI, Azure OpenAI, Cohere, Ollama, LM Studio
- LocalAI, Gemini, Voyage AI, Mistral, LiteLLM, Generic OpenAI

### Package Files: 4/4 found ✅
All key package.json files verified:
- Root package.json
- server/package.json  
- frontend/package.json
- collector/package.json

## Corrections Made

During verification, the following paths were corrected in the feature map:

1. **Vector Caching System**: Updated path from `/server/storage/vector-cache/` to `/server/storage/` (runtime: `vector-cache/`) to reflect that the vector-cache directory is created at runtime.

2. **Environment Configuration**: Updated from generic `.env.example` to specific component paths: `./server/.env.example`, `./frontend/.env.example`, `./collector/.env.example`, `./docker/.env.example`.

## Verification Script Features

The verification script (`scripts/verify-feature-map.sh`) includes:
- YAML frontmatter parsing for traceability
- Commit SHA verification against current repository state
- File and directory existence checking
- Provider implementation verification
- Comprehensive reporting with color-coded output
- Special handling for runtime directories and relative paths

## Next Steps

1. The feature map is now fully verified and traceable
2. Future updates should re-run the verification script
3. The script can be integrated into CI/CD pipelines for automated validation
4. Any missing items will be clearly reported for correction
